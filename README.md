<h2 align="center">About</h2>

Three words to describe me? I'll pick: **ambivert, determined, philomath**.

I enjoy playing video games and am usually seen listening to music. That's why I was often scolded as a child. ***"If you waste your time playing games on the computer, try learning something more useful on it,"*** my parents used to say. Because of them, after graduating from college, I decided to pursue a career in computers and programming.

I'm glad I followed my parents' advice, no matter how annoying it was at first. Now I enjoy learning a lot about programming, solving challenging issues, exploring and understanding various algorithms, and so on. It's truly fun, and I'm having a great time.

I have expertise in **Python** and can adapt to its **frameworks** and **modules** easily. I like to create and modify **discord bots** to learn and implement new features.

Have clear idea about **HTML, JavaScript, CSS** by doing personal WebApp projects.

Studying in **Computer Science** at **BRAC University**.
